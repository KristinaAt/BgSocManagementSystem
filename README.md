# BgSocManagementSystem
I made a management system in C language for the Bulgarian Society where I participate. When the program is run it shows up a menu of 5 options:

1)Add a new member

Allows you to add a member using there name, phone number, status in the club, date of birth, hometown, course and year of  education.

2)List all of the society members

Lists all the records of the members in the society.

3)Remove a member

Removes a member of the society given their name. It first checks whether that name is included in the records database.

4)Modify a member record

When this option is chosen another menu opens and you are allowed to select which particular record information you want to modify- name, phone number, status in the club, date of birth, hometown, course or year of  education.

5)Exit

You exit from the program.
